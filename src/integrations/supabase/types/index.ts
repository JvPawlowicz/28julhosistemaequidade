// NOTE: We are not re-exporting from './enums' or './tables' here.
// The concrete types `Enums` and `Tables` are defined in their own files
// and used by `database.ts`. The `database.ts` file now exports the generic
// utility types with the same names, which was previously done by the now-deleted helpers.ts.
// This ensures that importing `Tables` or `Enums` from this index file will correctly 
// resolve to the generic helpers, which is the intended use throughout the application.
